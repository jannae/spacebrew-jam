# Spacebrew Jam Session

Our awesome project from the ITP Spacebrew Workshop jam session today!

We created a collaborative (messy) drawing app for our in-class jam, using Spacebrew, d3.js, and the iOS touch event API. Anyone can log into the drawing interface on their iPhone, and view their own, and others' drawings interactively
